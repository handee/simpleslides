Simple slides

This is the most basic html/JavaScript slideshow I could make: 
it aims for ease of code understanding, rather than technical excellence.

I use it in lectures where I talk about HTML5 and JavaScript

It is loosely based upon Rob Flaherty's much more impressive slideshow software
If you want configurable and good looking slides, go to him:-)
